# Real-Time Chat application with Django channels and Vite

Implementation of a realtime chat application using websockets that are driven with django-channels and work with django native ASGI(Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) support, but still you can still write custom HTTP long-polling handling, or websocket receivers and have that code sit alongside your existing code, URL routing middleware-they are all just ASGI applications.
